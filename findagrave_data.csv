His mother died 6 Apr., one month after the birth of his sister Friederike on 6 Mar 1861. His father married Dorothea W Magnus on 12 Oct 1862. His parents had 11 more children. In May and June of 1882 the whole family immigrated to Canada including August's wife Mary and young daughter Bertha. They had followed Dorothea's sister Auguste Krause, brother's Gottfried and William, and mother Doro Magnus to Crediton. August and his sister Minnie Ewald Brown remained in Canada while the rest of the family moved to Elkton, Michigan in 1889 where his father purchased land at $1.50 an acre. August and Mary had at least 6 children: Bertha, Charles, Annie Telfer, Ida Redfern, Otto, and Ezra. August died of meningitis at age 55. I believe his wife and daughter Bertha are also buried in Crediton cemetery however there are no stones to indicate it. Crediton was listed as their place of burial on both death certificates.","EWALD

Ross was a life long resident of Stephen Township. He was a faithful member of the Evangelical and United churches in Dashwood and Crediton all his life, and he held a number of positions in Zion Church in Crediton since the 1950’s, including Sunday School Superintendent, Chief Usher, Treasurer and Chairman of the Board of Stewards.

He coached minor baseball teams in Dashwood and was a respected baseball and softball umpire for many years doing as many as 100 games each year. Ross joined the staff of the Exeter Times Advocate in 1963 as a two-week replacement for the sports-editor. That turned into a long career as photographer-reporter-editor. There are not likely many people who grew up or lived in the South Huron area in the 60s, 70s or 80s whose picture he hasn’t taken. He was editor of the Huron Soil and Crop News for more than 25 years. The career that was intended to end in 1990, continued on a part-time basis as a summer and maternity replacement until 1997. He remained as author of the popular “Back In Time” column until 2010. Anyone who knew Ross will also remember his quick wit and love of a good joke.
